sigue is composed of tools that allow users to track progress of students 
in one or more subjects and to generate reports periodically. It is 
tailored to Colombian schools, and includes an interface in PHP to 
facilitate the grading process (for teachers), and scripts to print 
reports for parents in LaTeX.
