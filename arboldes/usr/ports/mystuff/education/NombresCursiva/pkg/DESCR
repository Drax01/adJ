asigna receives information about the timetable of a school and some of 
its constraints, then it tries to arrange a timetable that satisfy the 
contraints by using an heuristic. It can also export the problem as an 
integer linear programming problem for lp_solve. It is highly portable and 
has a simple plain interface and a PHP interface.  Although it was developed 
with colombian schools in mind, possibly it will be useful in other contexts.
